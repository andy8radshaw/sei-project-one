Project One - BattleShips!




Overview
Battleships is an strategic type guessing game. Originating as a pencil and paper game dating from around World War I, then released in the 1960's as a board game. Skip to the current day, where the game has spawned a number of electronic versions. 

Commense battle and challenge yourself to sink all your opponents ships before they sink yours. 

This was my first project from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. It was an individual project built in 9 days, and was the first proper game I had built, and my first real-world type practice with JavaScript. 

Launch the game here on GitHub pages. Check out the GitHup Repo.
